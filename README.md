# astrophotography_sharp_and_denoise
Mega beta! I think I will improve these codes in the future.
Astrophotography tools: denoise for your images and sharpening.
Created using numpy, pil, scipy, astropy and etc.
How it works:
Sharpening uses unsharp(blur) mask, denoise uses 3 methods: tv_chambolle(change weight setting), kappa_sigma(change sigma setting) and median
Select your input path(click to browse input);
Select your output path(click to browse output):
Change weight, sigma settings for denoise and strength and radius for sharp;
After a little time you get the result.
