# astrophotography_sharp_and_denoise
Mega beta! I think I will improve these codes in the future.
Astrophotography tools: denoise for your images and sharpening.
Created using numpy, pil, scipy, astropy and etc.
How it works:
21.11 - Select path to your file w/ fits/fit or tiff/tif format 'n click start code. You will get a result in directory where is the .py file located. You can change strength and radius settings in the sharpening_test.py 'n weight in the denoise_test.py.
22.11 - Gui added, you can select a file path and change the radius and strength parameters without changing the code in sharpening tool. And you can change method and weight, sigma settings in denoise tool.
