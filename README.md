# astrophotography_sharp_and_denoise
Mega beta! I think I will improve these codes in the future.
Astrophotography tools: denoise for ur images and sharping.
Created using numpy, pil, scipy, astropy and etc.
How it works:
Select path to ur file w/ fits/fit or tiff/tif format 'n click start code. U will get a result in directory where where is the .py file located. U can change strength and radius settings in da sharpening_test.py 'n weight in da denoise_test.py
